# Android-PopularMovies-App


## Project Overview
  Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. We will split the development of this app in two stages. First, let's talk about stage 1.
    
## What did I Learn?
  Through this project, I:

  + You will fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
  + You will use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
  + You will incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write

# Android-PopularMovies-App, Stage2


## Project Overview
 Welcome back to Popular Movies! In this second and final stage, you’ll add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.

 You’ll add more information to your movie details view:

+ You’ll allow users to view and play trailers (either in the youtube app or a web browser).
+ You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
+ You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button (star).
+ You'll make use of Android Architecture Components (Room, LiveData, ViewModel and Lifecycle) to create a robust an efficient application.
+ You'll create a database using Room to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed   to display their favorites collection while offline).
+ You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.

## What Will I Learn After Stage 2
 + You will build a fully featured application that looks and feels natural on the latest Android operating system.
